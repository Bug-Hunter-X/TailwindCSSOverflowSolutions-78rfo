```javascript
<div class="flex items-center justify-center h-screen">
  <div class="bg-gray-200 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">My Component</h1>
    <p class="text-gray-700 text-base">This is a simple component.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```
This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling.  The issue is that if the content within the `bg-gray-200 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md` div grows larger than the parent div, it will overflow, causing the layout to break and the component to look distorted.  This could also happen if the content is dynamically generated and changes in size.
