# Tailwind CSS Overflow Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS related to content overflow in a styled component. The bug arises when the content dynamically added within a styled div exceeds the parent div's size, causing overflow and layout distortion.

## Bug Description:

A simple component styled with Tailwind CSS classes overflows when the content size exceeds the defined container boundaries. This breaks the intended layout and results in undesirable visual consequences.

## Solution:

The solution involves using appropriate Tailwind CSS directives to control the size and behavior of the container, preventing content overflow and ensuring a consistent layout.
